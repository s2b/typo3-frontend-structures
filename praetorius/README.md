## Information

This is a simple structure that I used for a (more or less) one-pager, so there is only one
extension (the sitepackage) and not much else in TYPO3. All frontend assets are placed in
`Private/` and will be bundled into `Public/` by a frontend tool (vite).

The following technologies are used:

* Fluid Components
* CSS with PostCSS
* Vanilla JavaScript

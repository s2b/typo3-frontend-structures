# A collection of TYPO3 frontend folder structures

Naming and structuring things is hard. And everyone has opinions about it. This is why there are various ways of structuring frontend assets in TYPO3 projects. This is an attempt to collect a few variants to make more informed decisions for potential frontend build tools for TYPO3.

## Instruction

Please check existing folder structures before adding your own. If your preferred structure does not exist yet, you can contribute yours as follows:

* fork this repository
* add a new folder with a speaking name to your fork and create the folder structure and example files within
* note that empty directories need a `.gitkeep` file or similar to be covered by git
* add a `README.md` to your new directory, containing contact information (e. g. name in TYPO3 Slack) and any further information you would like to add
* create a pull request in this repository for your fork

Thank you for your contribution!

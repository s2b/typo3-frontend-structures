Icons in Default/Icons are bundled into a svg symbols file to Generated/Default/sprite-default.svg, e.g. with 
svg-sprite. For a simple example see the build folder in this repo or
https://github.com/mmunz/c1_svg_viewhelpers#creating-svg-symbols-file-and-scss

Default/Icons might also be placed in Private folder, but it is handy sometimes to have the svg source files available
for public use, too.
